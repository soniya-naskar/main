# NEXT Datepicker

This project is a simple datepicker component that highlights an array of dates in a calendar.
The array used for the example is called `sessions` and is located in the [`src/data/sessions.ts`](src/data/sessions.ts) file.

The user can navigate through the months and years to select a date. 
The selected date is used to filter the `sessions` array and display those that are available on that date,
showing the user the number of sessions available on that date and the time of each session.

You can also go further by giving the user the option to click on a session to see more information about it if they want,
using the date and time of the session to filter some other data and display it.

You can use this component to filter lists of date and time related data.
